-STILL NEED TO DO:
-fix rins ability (finish later when its a problem and I can actually figure out what exactly to nerf)
-make troops for the last few floors of clash dungeon, evo cards, geared up buildings, clan captial buildings?
-max level variable for a card? Like switch case and default is 10 if its 26, its 5
-speed decrease ailment, everytime speed it reset, it increases it by the speed amount
-see what ailments your active character has in doPlayerAttack
A team button to display your teams HP before a battle.
maybe something to tell you what floor and level you are currently in


Wizard room:
-random welcome message.
-get 3 random spells and set their ids to negative
-thats it, maybe check if negative id cards get deleted at the end of your run


cards rewards: One time.
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19] 


Medium:
-some cards are just not worth having 10 levels, like barb barrel. Make every card have a max level stat. in the constructor, have a function to find the max level of the card given the ID
-change invisibility so that enemies dont choose invisible targets
-reward for cytus heardle trial is either essence or a temp card whos level is the amount of songs you got correct
-bug with calling upgarde after your go into characters and try to upgrade them. I have no idea whats wrong so it just throws an error and you have to restart
-change melee boost to be 2.13x more damage instead of 113% more damage
-stun ailment, make it so that you do more damage to frozen units
-needfs to be a way to load dungeons (??? idk what this is talking about)
-make the really cool thing in the upgrade character that has all the ability buffs but its like crossed out
-cards have a tier field, but no functionality. Code the prestiege mechanic later, with leveling up single target cards to all target cards.
-when you place a character down, should its speed be scrambled?
-maybe different tiered cards should cost different amounts to upgrade idk
-make a talk option for the blacksmith and he says "If you need to upgrade anything, I can do it for you for a price if you bring me the MMessence. I need money to buy VOEZ Pack 1
-if someones still in the dungeon while the dungeon resets, if they are in a battle, they can finish it and it puts them in the main menu. If not, they automatically leave with all their loot

Not very high priority:
be able to use cards during boost
-should summon cards have decay? Wait and see
wagon action where you can replace a card
A voice line field for enemy. So they can say stuff or something
shield ailment where it takes a certain amount of hits to break it.
life steal, where you heal yourself with the hp you steal, custom % of hp healed
make an enemy that gives a big damage boost when it dies, so a swarm of those enemies, should be taken out evenly instead of lowest hp first


Archer Queen boss:
-has a low base speed like 3
-has giant arrow attack - hits all enemies (3 superCharge)
-frozen arrow - freezes its target for 1 turn (3 superCharge)
-healer puppet - summons 3 healers (3 superCharge)
-at 50% health, she goes invisizble for 3 turns, summons 10 archers

King boss:
-king tower, 2 princess towers
-have spells that he uses to inflict ailments.
-summons recruits idk, royal troops. So Royal giant, knight, royal hogs, princess, little prince?

Clash of clans base:
town hall
a bunch of cannons, archer towers and stuff at the beginning.
then theres like scattershot, xbow, monolith and all that stuff comes in later

Royal Champion:
-medium speed
-seeking shield super (deals massive damage (150) to 3 random enemies), hast vial super (increase speed)
-at 30%hp: heal to full, summon 7 hog riders
-maybe rocket spear ability where she shoots 5 high damage spears to random enemies




every character should have a super ability. If you guard, it charges the ability. 
Coded in super charge variable that increases whenever you guard but nothing else


make a dungeon room class that has a pointer to a functin

have all these functions with dungeon rooms and stuff

dungeonInfo:
[isDungeon, isBattle, [floor, room], [players, enemies, type, hand, xp, wagonSpeed, characterChance, numBoosts], loot]





have a 2d array where the first row is all the easy rooms
second row is intermediate and 
third is hard





Boss Fight:
Guess a Cytus Song, deal Massive damage to the boss,
You can choose to guess the song on any of your character's turns. If you guess wrong, you take damage (10% of Max HP).
The more damage you do to the boss, the more seconds you get for the song (1 second every 10%)




ideas:
A room where you sacrifice cards in your deck for essence
some trial that has to do with answering cytus heardles correctly
a thing where you have to answer with songs, like "answer all ROBO_Head songs" and then you literally just type them out. you have 3 lives
a room where you can sacrifice the cards in your deck for CAPSO Coins or MMessense.
A blacksmith room, where you can upgrade a card for free (reverts back at the end of your run)
A shop, you can get money for every kill and can spend it here. 
nominate a person on your team, they will get an ailment for the next battle, or they could lose hp or something, but you will get a reward
A guy who makes someone take damage and gives you their health as a healing card
vending machine with cards in it?
booster pack??
A room where you can combine 2 cards and make a card that calls cardManager multiple times. Maybe the tradeoff is you cant upgrade the card anymore after that
A feature where you can mount a weapon on your wagon.

OS world:
-Room where you play a random cytus song and they give you a cytus heardle and you have to answer if that song is the one you just played
-A way to obtain CAPSOs
-You use the CAPSOs to buy song parts and theres an area where you can craft them into "songs", which are just cards
-"You played CODE NAME: GAMMA to your party. It increased their attack for ____ turns"
-song parts are like titles, difficulties, length. At the end, you have to play the song in Cytus and give your score.
-send help on IM. You'll get some random IM user on your team.

Vanessa- has ended virus ability: gives entire enemy team decay

Enemy ideas:
Drones that attack xenon and cherry?

People who took over Nora’s company
Architect 

Card donation room
-ask to donate a random card in your deck. (Discard). Then you get like 10 CAPSO coins or something. Only once per dungeon. 

Go into your recycling bin and take out a card you have already used

Maybe a room to revive a dead character. Say like 50 essence or something. Or free

A room to get a really good card. (Cytus trial?)
Maybe Cytus trial is if you get all 5, you get to do 5 more. And that’s the level of your card

Song creation room?

Clone:
-makes clones of your entire team. They have 1 Hp. Maybe 10% of normal attack and only lasts 1 turn. Upgrades can be increasing the attack and increase by the turn

Lightning:
Hits the highest 3 HP enemies

Magic item rework - maybe make the prices dependent of the one you got right



You fight songs?
Maybe some new battle system. You have to “compose” songs or you “play them” like a Cytus level idk.
Multiple steps to hacking the enemies. Cytus Heardle, but idk what else the hacks should have

A way to hack the enemies like bring the IM users offline. You do this by doing Cytus Heardles or something. 

Make your own IM profile

You have to kill them and figure out what their Cytus song is maybe?
The only problem is that it might make Cytus hearldes too easy cause you do them so often





Clash Royale/Clash of clans world:
-room where someone is requesting cards (a random card in your deck) and you can donate it to him

helper character you find in the dungeon. Only stays with you for your run




Boss is a hard Cytus Heardle song. With modifiers. It’s the same song for everyone 
- Take damage if you guess it wrong
-You use your action to guess the song, if you do, it will greatly weaken the boss (like maybe 90% of its hp, or 80% or 50% idk. Hey maybe the lower the floor, the less it weakens it.)
-You can damage the boss to get more time for the video

Bring back the letter power up but you take damage every use

tier 1 cards should have the same upgrade
tier 2 cards should have the same upgrade costs
and so on
upgrades need: xp - get from playing the card
essence - get from sacrificing cards and winning battles and stuff


wagon leveling
starts at 100HP
+10 hp per level
the cost only increases every 100 HP
100-200 - 10 CAPSO Coins 5
200-300 - 20 CAPSO Coins 6-10
300-400 - 30 CAPSO Coins 11-15

                 80
                 90
2250 total

Boost the same but increase by 25

Deck is a consitant 50 CAPSO Coins

characters HP and Atk:
lvl1 - 10 or  10 CAPSO Coins
lvl2 - 20       10

lvl8 - 150     75
lvl9 - 175     85
lvl10 - 200   100
total  1010   550
Ability:
essence is HP/Atk but doubled? idk

Blacksmith:
have to pay capso coins and essence to upgrade a card
tier 1:
lvl2 - 5 CC  2XP  10 MMessence
lvl3 - 5 CC 5XP   20MM
lvl4 - 5 CC 10XP 35 MM
lvl5 - 5CC  15XP 50 MM
lvl6 - 10CC25XP 75 MM
lvl7 - 10CC35XP 100 MM
lvl8 - 10CC50XP 125 MM
lvl9 - 10CC75XP 150 MM
lvl10 -10CC100XP 200MM
Prestiege cards can be obtained by combining 2 of the same MAX level cards
prestiege:
lvl1 - 5 CC  2XP  10 MMessence
lvl2 - 5 CC  5XP  15 MM
lvl3 - 5 CC 10XP 20MM
lvl4 - 5 CC 15XP 35 MM
lvl5 - 5CC  25XP 50 MM

lvl8 - 10CC50XP 125 MM
lvl9 - 10CC75XP 150 MM
lvl10 -10CC100XP 200MM
salvage:
FREE, lvl 1 should give 10 MMessence?
-depends on how much you actually get
maybe the sacrifice should be the cost in essence to upgrade to the next level

Gameplay should not be just attacking. Every character should have an additional ability and you should be able to win a battle in a few turns if you play correctly

Ability ideas:
negotiate with an enemy and get their card.

Easrly game, cards should be hard to get. Late game, cards should be abundant and its easy to get a large amount of them. The challenge could be managing your cards


Progression:
Cards should be upgradable and fine tunable. For example, the card you collect will all be base tier cards, these can then be upgraded/fine tuned to be stronger, but will require you do a Cytus Heardle to work
Cards you find in the dungeon are temporary, can be a room where you sacrifice your temp cards for CAPSO Coins or MMessence
set speed to random things at the start of a battle
Upgrade health and attack - CAPSO Coins
Upgrade ability - MMessense


CARD IDEAS:
healing card variant that lets you heal above max hp or maybe thats just a shield
cards that give you a free magic item, like a squirrel in a bottle, but its like reveal character in a bottle
cards that extend the length of a video
MAX ENERGY - level 1 - 10% chance to set your speed to 0, increase by 10 each level until 100% to set your speed to zero
MAX ENERGY - 6 Pack - same but it is set your party speed to 0
hypercharge - deal more damage, get a % shield so like damage reduciton, something with higher speed


deals damage to every enemy 50


deals some damage to someone 100
+20 damage per level
MAX: 300 damage to someone
You can take other paths, that will mutate the cards, so maybe they will have different levels and stuff
lvl 3 - inflicts poison, burn, weakness, or fragile, unlock Cytus Heardle
lvl 7 - inflicts the selected one but buffs its damage
lvl 9 - inflicts a second ailment, but its not as strong
lvl 10 - idk maybe a choice to remove th second ailment and make it hit everyone??
or remove all ailments, but it does a lot of damage

instant kill:
MAX: instantly kills a random person if you do a cytus heardle (havent thought of what it should be yet)

boost your teams attack by 50% for 3 turns

gives your entire team a 1000 shield for 1 turn

power up: gives your entire team a 1% stat boost
MAX: gives your entire team a 10% stat boost

cure: cures someone 1 turn of their negative ailments

quick speed: 
MAX: reduced all your character's speeds to 0


money: gives 1% more money at the end of this battle (passive)
MAX: gives 10% more money


adds 1 second to a Cytus Heardle
lvl 2 - +1 second (2)
lvl 3 - +1 second (3)
lvl 4 - +1 second (4)
lvl 5 - +1 second (5) 
 upgradable to 5 seconds

skips the Cytus Heardle, but your current character has 1 HP

reveal character in a bottle



mainly through dungeon loot and Cytus heardle
you should get 1 key every week, with the option to buy 2 more for CAPSO Coins
secondary currency could be "power points". To get power points, you sacrifice your cards. You get cards with capso coins. Maybe you have to sacrifice permanent cards? temporary cards can give you capso coins or something

Permament upgrades:
These are upgrades you can buy with CAPSO Coins
starting hand - buy up to 3 cards appear in your starting hand
shop slots - you start with 3, can buy up to 6 slots
character upgrades
-buy a second, harder boost option
-deck size, maybe tied to the amount of characters you upgrade?? an incentive to upgrade more characters



generates 2 positive modifiers, 2 negative modifiers, 1 of each will be increasing/decreasing the time, 1 either positive or negative modifier



offers:
attack - increase damage by 10-30%, 5 second video, normal
incorrect guess - 5-20% of Max HP
+ 10% if scrambled
+ 15% if duo
+ 20% if reverse
+ 30% if quad
+ 10% for fragmented
+ 10% for -1 second
+ 20% for -2 seconds
+ 35% for -3 seconds
+ 50% for -4 seconds
+ 60% for -4.5 seconds
+ -5% for another character
+ 100% for a song you may not know

- 5% for +1 second
- 10% for + 2 seconds

Card 1:
increase damage by 10-35%, 3 second, scrambled



passive ability cards


Not important rn (Refernce for future maybe):
Cytus Heardles:

In game, you will have the option to boost some cards by getting a Cytus Heardle correct. You can choose to increase the difficulty by giving yourself less time or adding more modifiers. The harder the song, the bigger the buff, BUT if you fail you will take damage. You take more damage the harder the difficulty.
boost could be a toggleable switch in the first menu, when it is on, it will offer you a cytus heardle with some base stat increases. (kind of random, but not really random where its totally worth it or totally not worthit) You are able to tune it by making it harder (or maybe easier?) which will increase/decrease the rewards if you get it right. Everytime you get it wrong, you will take a little bit of damage, maybe there is a chance when you get it wrong, it will offer you a magic item or increase the time for more hp. You can keep guessing until your character dies or you give up. If you give up, you will take significant damage

Cards:
You can buy cards in the shop every day with CAPSO Coins
cards should be a variety and you can play different builds. Like different characters should have different cards good for them
cards can be active abilities or passive, such as a card where you earn more coins (10%) in the dungeon or a card that can damage every enemy when used.
You cant carry all of your cards, but maybe you can be able to add more cards from your collection to your deck
Leveling up cards will cost multiple of the same card and some MMessence


Dungeon:
card class
player class
enemy class
battle function w/ a card manager that will find the id of the card and do the thing
class for every character??
toString for every class for the reader and writer
Cards can be boosted if you choose to complete a cytus heardle. The more modifiers you add and the shorter the video, the better boost you'll get, but you will take more damage if you get it wrong
You get your cards every game and they can be like "power up" and increase you atk. Certain cards are a one time use tho

you have action points, some cards use 0 action points, some will use more than 1, everytime you cycle your speed, you get an action point. If you guard, you keep your action points and will gain one in your next attck

Player:
has a list of cards in their collection
has a list of characters w/ their levels
has amount of CAPSO Coins


Battle:
check the players character's speed if its less than or equal to 0
for each character who passes, they do the amount of actions equal to their action points
sets speed to their speed stat
check if any player or enemy's health is less than zero
if they are, remove them the their respective lists
check if enemy's speed is less than or equal to zero
if it is, do the enemy action
check if any player character or enemies are less than zero, if they are, remove them from the list
subtract enemy and player speeds by 1
