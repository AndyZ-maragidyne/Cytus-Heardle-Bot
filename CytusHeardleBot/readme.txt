This is a discord bot that has two major functionalities:

1. It gets a random song from the rhythm game "Cytus" and makes the user try and guess it. 
It is imilar to the daily song guessing game heardle, where the user starts with a one second clip of the song 
and can listen to more of the song with each incorrect guess.

Also contains:
-support for different gamemodes:
   -scrambled: song starts at a random time instead of at the beginning
   -hard mode: song lengths are halved
   -fragmented: song jumps to a different part every second
   -reverse: song is reversed
   -chromatic: each video is a different song and you have to guess all 6
   -duo: switches between 2 different songs
   -quad: switches between 4 different songs
   Gamemodes can stack, meaning there can be multiple activated at the same time   
-power up system:
   -When the user completes a level, they get coins that can be used to make future levels easier by obtaining information about the song
   such as what character it's from, or what the difficulty is.
   -not very balanced
-profile system to keep track of the player's coins, winstreak and information for the other game
-command to play any song in the bot's library
   -The bot can join your active voice channel and play the song live, or send a video of it
