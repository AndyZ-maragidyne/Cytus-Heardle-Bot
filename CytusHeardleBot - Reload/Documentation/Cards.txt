thoughts:
    MAYBE: add a prestige cards like "shield II" that start at a higher
    base shield, but to get it, you sacrifice your MAX "shield I" card
    AND THEN shield I cards are balanced around floor 1 of the dungeon
    shield II floor 2 and so on
    upgrading the boost result is another option?
